# Software’s required

	Eagle software

# Procedure

Collect all relevant information about the product for which you are preparing the BOM. </br>
Break down the product into its individual components, sub-assemblies, and raw materials. </br>
Create a list of all the components needed for the product. Include details such as part numbers, descriptions, and any specifications required for each component. </br>
Determine the quantity of each component required for the product. </br>
If there are multiple options for certain components or materials, include them in the BOM along with their specifications </br>
Calculate the total quantity of each component needed for the entire production run or specified period </br>
Review the BOM to ensure accuracy and completeness. </br>
Organize the BOM in a clear and logical format. Use tables or spreadsheets to present the information in a structured manner </br>

# Theory

### What is a BOM?”

A bill of materials (BOM) is an extensive list documenting all the parts and components required to build an electronic product based on a printed circuit board (PCB) design. The BOM serves as a master guide through the entire manufacturing process spanning across procurement, assembly, testing and fulfillment stages.For any complex piece of electronic equipment containing hundreds or thousands of discreet parts that need to be sourced, populated and validated, maintaining an accurate BOM is absolutely essential for managing production. Without a properly structured BOM guiding both human operators and automated systems, assembling modern PCBs would essentially be impossible.So in essence, the bill of materials is at the core of translating a completed PCB hardware design into a physical reality.

### Key Elements Comprising a PCB Bill of Materials

An effective BOM for facilitating PCB assembly is much more than just a simple list of components. It is a meticulously structured datasheet encompassing vital details on every individual item that collectively comprises the build of materials needed for a board-level product.
Here are the typical data categories captured within an electronics BOM:
Part Number — Unique identifier code for each component </br>
Description — Text name stating exactly what the part is </br>
Manufacturer — Company that produces the component </br>
Manufacturer Part Number — The specific part number used by the manufacturer </br>
Component Package — Physical form factor, case style, footprint </br>
Reference Designator — Matching ID code labeled on PCB design prints </br>
Location — Where part mounts on board (component placement) </br>
Quantity — Number of units needed on hand </br>
Beyond this, additional columns may specify pricing, sourcing information, board layer side, tolerances, alternate substitutes, lifecycle status, assembly instructions and other specifics as applicable per product

### BOM Role in Assembly

When components start arriving to the factory, they need to be prepared and kitted out for loading onto PCBs along optimized assembly lines. Here the bill of materials transforms into a Production BOM focused on enabling swift manufacturing activity.
Some of the ways this Production BOM guides assembly includes:
•	Line Layout — Group components into assemblies stations </br>
•	Machine Programming — Configure pick-and-place order, rotations & positions </br>
•	Stencil Designs — Determine solder paste layer patterns </br>
•	Manual Kitting — Organize parts for operators </br>
•	Testing — Specify test points & limits </br>
So for high volume SMT lines, the Production BOM provides critical manufacturing build instructions down to all details needed for each specific board variant.

### BOM Role in Serviceability

During the product life, components may fail needing repair or upgrade. Here the bill of materials continues providing value in the form of a Service BOM.Field maintenance, troubleshooting and warranty repair activities rely on service BOM data such as:
•	Lifecycle Status — Is part still active for replacement </br>
•	Alternate Parts — Substitute items if needed </br>
•	Repair Guides — Component removal, orientation info </br>
•	Diagnostics — Expected voltages, signal values </br>
